# Tower-Defense-JackO
Remade Repository to clean up problems with old one

10th July 2022
- First playable Demo version of the game.
- 3 Tower Types, each with 1 Upgrade:
	Standard Turret, average single target damage and attack speed.
	Missile Launcher, lower damage and attack speed, but higher range and AOE damage.
	Laser Beamer, single target damage over time, average range, slows attacked enemies
- 3 Enemy types:
	Blue, standard enemy with average health and speed
	Red, Tough enemy with high health but lowered speed
	Yellow, Fast enemy with low health but high speed
- 3 Playable levels currently.

TO DO:
- Complete Asset overhaul planned with Assets from unity assetstore
  - with asset overhaul, the theme will likely turn into something more medieval with archer towers, cannon towers etc.
- More enemy variations
- Mixed wave functionality (more than 1 type of enemy per wave)
- (Maybe) Instructions option on main menu
- More levels
- Endless mode?
